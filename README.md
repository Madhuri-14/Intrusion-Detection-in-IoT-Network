# Intrusion-Detection-in-IoT-Network

Intrusion Detection in Internet of Things. IoT devices, which are always connected to internet, are more susceptible to botnet attacks. To prevent such attacks, machine learning models can be built to classify normal network traffic from the once caused by botnets. Also, dimensionality reduction can be used to reduce the time taken to train data. This research is on how we can detect the intrusion traffic caused in the Internet of things (IOT) network by botnets.
